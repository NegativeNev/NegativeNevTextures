# What the FUCK is this???

A simple Balatro reskin mod that adds an option to customize the face cards in the "Customize Deck" menu.\
This mod requires [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods), a popular Balatro modding framework, to work.

# How the FUCK do I use it???

Provided that you successfully installed Steamodded, paste the following into the file explorer's address bar:\
`%AppData%/Balatro/Mods`  
Unzip the archive inside the Mods folder, and you're good to go!\
\
(Warning: After extracting the zip file, the Mods folder should contain a folder named "nn_textures" that contains all the content!)
